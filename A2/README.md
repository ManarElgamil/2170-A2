## Description

One paragraph description of the assignment work goes here.

This assignment implements several forms and  processes these forms in different ways, for example in the login form we use databases, while in the comments form, we use associative arrays and JSON to process this form without databases. We also implement file redirection and flow between different webpages. We also implement responsive designs using bootstrap to produce a professional looking website. 

How I implemented this assignemnt (important):

Used Bootstrap which resulted in making the website responsive and professional looking, all forms are implemented correctly, 
successfully implemented file resusability by having one footer and one header for all the files, login form is implemented correctly and functionals correctly (Please make sure to implement the file paths specified correctly when marking), submit-comments form is implemented correctly and stores the stored the data submitted in an associative array and JSON format, but I was unable to reload the page to the same articles and I was also unable to display the comments with on the same page of the article they were submitted. I tried my best though (you can take a look at my commented out code, in the submit-comments.php file)
